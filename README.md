# EurorackSequencer
This is a project for creating an esp32c6 based eurorack sqequqncer using cursor AI as a coding assistant and Kicad for the schennatic capture and pcb layout.

This repository and it's contents can be used for individual builds or group builds if you are doing that to make the pcb costs more effectie. 

This repository can NOT be used for anyone wanting to manufacture this device. This is not for wholesale resellers or fooks to pilfer because they suck at doing their own designs. ;) (or any other lame reason!) 

I will be pushing code to this repo for a while until the device is finished and fully tested. 

Feel free to download it and play with it if you wish, though it helps to buy one of my boards to run it on. ;)
